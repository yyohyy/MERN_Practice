# MERN Wishlist 

## Overview

This Wishlist Website is a practice exercise, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their wishlist items. This project serves as a practical exercise for understanding the core concepts of the MERN stack and building a full-stack application.
